/**
## Simple & Efficient Data Structure
The core of the library is a simple and efficient halfedge mesh data structure for storing and processing polygon surface meshes. It has been carefully designed and implemented with a focus on ease of use and performance while maintaining high flexibility.

## Tried & Tested Algorithms
On top of the core data structure the library provides implementations of canonical geometry processing algorithms such as mesh simplification based on error quadrics, curvature adaptive remeshing, subdivision, smoothing, or parametrization.
